try_rails_presentation
======================

HINTS: Before even introducing the app I want to give a couple pieces of advice to people attempting to create this app.

1) Every Piece of code you need to touch is wrapped like this:  <<< some code >>>. Global search for "<<<" in your editor to find what work you need to do!

2) When you see a hint wrapped in <<< >>>DO NOT DELETE IT! Instead copy it and write your code under it. That way you can use those hints as you are writing the code.

3) Read the hints carefully! I tried to provide as much info as possible in them.

4) You can find all of the answers at https://github.com/Andrew-Max/try_rails_presentation. You will benefit from trying to solve the problems on your own but if you are really stuck, get some help!


This is the normal dificulty mode version of my "Try rails" challenge at the Try New Tech meetup at Revv in Pittsburgh Pa on 6/18/14.
During this set of challenges you will take an existing rails app with most of the important logic removed and turned into hints so it can be recreated.

There is still a huge amount of info in here for the rails beginner so take your time, read error messages carefully when they come up and ask for help when you are stuck!

Good luck!

STEP 1) Create the routes:

 * the routes defined in the config/routes.rb file define your apps url's and what logic they talk to. During the presentation we will od this as a group but if you are wroking through on your own, use google and read the existing notes in the routes.rb file to figure out the syntax.

STEP 2) Go into app/models and go into each of the model files and follow the instructions to create the model logic for the apps two models.

STEP 3) Go into app/controllers and follow the instructions to create the logic for the users_controller.rb and the messages_controller.rb files

STEP 4) Go into app views and follow the instructions in each of the view files to get your app running.

At this point you should have a working app!

As a follow up challenge see if you can get the update and delete actions to work for messages and users. Note that you will have to create controller logic as well as updating the UI to get this to work.
